<p>Yes, that word, too.

<p>Click venue names (like "Bushwick") to display only the events that take

  from the listing.

<p>Click on the event check mark to mark an event as something you'd
  possibly be interested in.

<p>If you have selected some events, you can export these via the iCal
  link that will then appear.

<p>If you've visited this site (un this browser) before, a new link
  called "List events arrived since last time" will appear that will
  list only events that have arrived since the last time you visited
  this site.
  
<p>None of your selections are stored on the csid.no web site.
  Everything happens locally in your browser through the wonders of
  Javascript.

  It gets its listings by "web scraping" the programme pages of the
  various venues.  The web site is untouched by human hands.
