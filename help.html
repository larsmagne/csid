<p>Click venue names (like "Bushwick") to display only the events that take

  called "List events arrived since last time" will appear that will
  list only events that have arrived since the last time you visited
  this site.
  
<p>None of your selections are stored on the csid.no web site.
  Everything happens locally in your browser through the wonders of
  Javascript.
